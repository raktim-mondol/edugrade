    "Method Introduction: Logistic Regression\n",
    "Logistic regression is a classic linear classifier that directly models the conditional probability relationship between feature vectors and category labels. In multi-classification scenarios, the commonly used \"polynomial\" logistic regression (in the form of softmax) calculates for each category c:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(y=c \\mid x) = \\frac{\\exp(w_c^T x + b_c)}{\\sum_{k=1}^{K}\\exp(w_k^T x + b_k)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The model learns the weights w and biases b by maximizing the log-likelihood on the training set (plus the L1/L2 regularization term).\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason for selection\n",
    "1. Medium-dimensional, efficient training\n",
    "although will eventually arise through CountVectorizer/TfidfVectorizer thousand magnitude characteristic, but relative to the sample size (1500) material is not \"a\" high dimensional.\n",
    "Logistic Regression (especially solver='lbfgs' or saga) converges rapidly on such medium-dimensional and sparse data, and the training can be completed within a few seconds.\n",
    "2. Native multi-classification support (Softmax)\n",
    "Set multi_class='multinomial' + solver='lbfgs', and directly perform five-class Softmax regression without the need for manual \"one-to-many\" splitting. The model form is simple and the probability output is consistent.\n",
    "3. It can output probabilities, which is convenient for subsequent recommendation ranking\n",
    "model.predict_proba() gives the confidence that each sample belongs to five topics. Later, in the recommendation system, these probabilities can be directly used for ranking or combined with other signals.\n",
    "4. Powerful regularization and resistance to overfitting\n",
    "• Built-in L2 (or L1/ Elaste-Net) regularization. By adjusting C (the inverse of regularization intensity), it can smooth out the noise of a few class emotions (only 79) and avoid overfitting on small classes.\n",
    "5. Model interpretability\n",
    "When viewing model.coef_, you can directly know which words (features) are the most important for which topic, which is convenient for understanding and optimizing feature engineering.\n",
    "6. Parameter adjustment is simple\n",
    ", just consider C, penalty, super parameter class_weight this several, GridSearchCV/StratifiedKFold next a few minutes to get the optimal configuration."

    "#####\t[dark]:\n",
    "There are words like fight, black, blood, kill, grave, evil, ghost in the word cloud... All of them are very much in line with the meaning of \"dark\" (darkness/terror).\n",
    "However, there are also common words like \"grind\", \"gon\", \"come\", \"know\", and \"yeah\", indicating that your cleaning/stopping words are not strict enough.\n",
    "#####\t[sadness]:\n",
    "cry, tear, blame, leave, pain, hurt, forever, mean…  All point to \"sadness and pain\".\n",
    "The only ones that are slightly off track are music, write, smile and the like. This is probably the background noise that comes with the lyrics.\n",
    "#####\t[personal]:\n",
    "life, live, world, change, dream, teach, learn…  It is very much in line with the meaning of \"about self/life insights\".\n",
    "The colloquial words like \"good\", \"like\", \"yeah\", \"know\" can be considered to be added to the additional deactivation list.\n",
    "#####\t[lifestyle]:\n",
    "song, night, play, party*(stranger?) , dance*(closer?) ... Overall, it reflects the scene of \"nightlife/party/singing\", which is very reasonable.\n",
    "But phrases like spoil, wan, time, tire occur frequently, probably because they were vectorized without taking into account the context such as bi-grams and noun phrases.\n",
    "#####\t[emotion]:\n",
    "youth, goodbye, freedom, friend, future, heal, grow…  These words are relevant to \"emotion/release\".\n",
    "However, it is rather general and almost exactly the same among several users, indicating that the emotion topic has not been distinguished by the differentiated interests of users.\n",
    "\n",
    "User2\n",
    "#####\t[sadness]:\n",
    "heart, break, scar, tear, silence, away…  It focuses on the \"heartbreak/loss\" scene and is more concentrated than the sadness of User1.\n",
    "#####\t[emotion]:\n",
    "It is exactly the same as User1, but still too universal.\n",
    "\n",
    "User2 only prefers sad + emotion, so the keywords \"dark\", \"lifestyle\" and \"personal\" are missing from the portrait.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "User3\n",
    "##### [dark]:\n",
    "fight, black, ghost, evil…  A typical \"dark/terrifying\" image, which is very relevant to the theme.\n",
    "oooh, come, feel, know…  For this type of verbal interference, it is recommended to include additional stop words.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### [emotion]:\n",
    "youth, goodbye, freedom, heal, grow…  These words express the emotions of \"youth/liberation/growth\".\n",
    "game, get, girl, give, good…  There are too many high-frequency general words, lacking differentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### [lifestyle]:\n",
    "song, country, sing, morning, road…  Create an atmosphere of \"listening to music during the journey\" and \"morning coffee\".\n",
    "yeah, baby, tire, mind…  There are too many common filler words, which weakens the theme's characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### [personal]:\n",
    "life, dream, reflect, promise, learn…  Depict the image of \"self-reflection and growth\".\n",
    "know, time, come, thing…  It is suggested to expand the stop word list to eliminate common verbs.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### [sadness]:\n",
    "memory, ache, farewell, longing…  Strong feelings of \"nostalgia/parting\".\n",
    "baby, arm, wave, land…  These picture words are prone to cause ambiguity. n-gram or context filtering can be considered."
